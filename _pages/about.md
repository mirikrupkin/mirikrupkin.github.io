I am a structural biologist studying HIV infection on the molecular level at [Stanford university](https://profiles.stanford.edu/miri-krupkin). My passion is to reveal the molecular basis of infectious diseases and to expand our understanding of antibiotics and antiviral drugs. My research brings the structure of large RNAs to life by tracking their real-time rearrangement in situ and revealing its function in human health and disease. I focus on the regulatory role of RNA structures in reverse transcription of the HIV virus. In my research, I develop structural biology and biophysical tools to track the viral RNA rearrangments inside the HIV virus during reverse transcription. 


## Past accomplishments

### HIV viral RNA
Originally, I trained as a chemist during my BSc. My postdoctoral research focus is on revealing the regulatory role of RNA structures in reverse transcription of the HIV virus, at my postdoctoral research at the [Puglisi labs](https://puglisi.stanford.edu). The role of RNA structures in early steps of reverse transcription are poorly understood. Specifically, the complex process of reverse transcription initiation and the first event of strand transfer. My analysis of reverse transcription initiation, from the structural biology perspective, highlights the fascinating questions and current challenges to understanding this process (Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 2020). My analysis of the mutation pattern at the 5’UTR of HIV vrial RNA reveals structure-function relationship (J Gen Virol, 2023). I set up a system to prepare a synthetic full-length viral RNA in the lab allows to start revealing the architecture and dynamics of the HIV viral RNA (in progress). This work paves the road to structural studies to reveal the conformational landscape of HIV viral RNA during reverse transcription.

### Mucus in health and disease 
During my time at MIT, I focused on developing a system to study the structure and function of mucus by using purified mucin gels and microfluidics (Krupkin et al, Biomacromolecules, 2023). My work set the foundation to study the interaction between mucins and human Galactin-3 (JACS Au, 2024), and Intelectin 2 (submitted) using mucus gel that I reconstituted from mucins I purified. This work lays the basis for clinical research of the permeability of various mucus layers, which plays a key role in health and disease. Furthermore, my system can be used to study drug delivery.

### Ribosomal antibiocis 
I completed my PhD under the mentorship of [Professor Ada Yonath](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sb/Pages/Yonath/), at the Weizmann Institute of Science, focusing on the ribosome structure, function, and evolution. 
During my graduate research I became fascinated with natural products used to treat infectious diseases. Specifically, I wanted to understand the molecular mechanism of avilamycin, a polysaccharide ribosomal antibiotic. For this purpose, I solved the crystal structure of avilamycin, both free and in complex with the bacterial ribosome (Krupkin et al, PNAS 2016). First, I used cutting edge crystallographic machinery and software to determine the structure of the full-length free avilamycin, pushing the abilities to determine small molecule structures. Then, by analyzing the structure of the bound drug, I revealed how avilamycin is utilizing the tRNA binding and the accommodation path to hinder the ribosomal activity. In addition, I uncovered how ribosomal mutations can change the binding pocket and create bacterial resistance to the drug. Furthermore, I elucidated how the differences between the human and the bacterial ribosome constitute the basis for the selectivity, an essential feature for effective antibiotics. 
In addition to my main project described above, I contributed to uncovering the structure of large ribosomal subunit from the life-threatening pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and of its complexes with various antibiotics (Eyal et al 2015, Eyal et al 2016, Matzov et al 2017, Wekselman et al 2017), by crystal fishing and freezing, data collection and analysis. These studies expand our understanding of species-specific resistance and drug inhibition mechanisms of multi drug resistance pathogens. More recently, I contributed to development of new synthetic tRNAs for synthetic biology, by building the model of the synthetic tRNA, and data analysis and identification of which nucleotides to mutate to allow for efficiant translation (Prabhakar et al. 2022).

### Ribosomal origins 
In addition, I proposed a novel hypothesis that the ribosome has evolved from the [pre-proto-ribosome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158926/), a molecular machine capable of performing essential tasks in the RNA world. I studied the ability of the ribosome to form peptide bonds at the peptidyl transferase center. I suggested a novel hypothesis for the origin of this active site in the evolution from the pre-proto-ribosome (Krupkin et al, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 2011). This pre-proto- ribosome was a molecular machine capable of performing essential tasks in the RNA world, which was later snatched for producing proteins by the amino acids invaders. To explore this hypothesis, I reconstructed the ribosomal active site from short RNA strands I designed. I showed that these RNA molecules were able to dimerize (Bose et al, NAR 2022), as I hypothesized from the ribosome structure, and was supported by computational approaches (Huang, Krupkin, et al. PNAS 2013). Furthermore, these molecules were able to perform peptide-bond formation! My research contributes to the understanding of the emergence and evolution of protein translation; a process central to all known life forms.
