I am a structural biologist studying HIV infection on the molceular level at [Stanford university](https://profiles.stanford.edu/miri-krupkin). My passion is to reveal the molecular basis of infectious diseases and to expand our understanding of antibiotics and antiviral drugs. I focus on the regulatory role of RNA structures in reverse transcription of the HIV virus. I use structural biology and biophysics to track the viral RNA rearrangments during reverse transcription of the HIV virus.

Background
======
Originally, I was trained as a chemist during my BSc. I completed my PhD under the mentorship of [Professor Ada Yonath](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sb/Pages/Yonath/), at the Weizmann Institute of Science, focusing on the ribosome structure, function, and evolution. I elucidated the activity, selectivity, and resistance mechanisms of [avilamycin](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/E6796), a ribosomal polysaccharide antibiotics. In addition, I proposed a novel hypothesis that the ribosome has evolved from the [pre-proto-ribosome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158926/), a molecular machine capable of performing essential tasks in the RNA world.

Other Interests
======
I am devoted to promoting science education and outreach. 
In my spare time, I love to do yoga.
